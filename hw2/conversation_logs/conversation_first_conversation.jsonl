To avoid sharing incorrect information, I suggest:\n\n1. You could ask the other agents to provide basic information about Project NANDA first\n2. Then you can ask clarifying questions based on what they share\n3. Be specific about what aspects of the project interest you most\n\nWould you like me to help you formulate a clear initial question to the other agents about Project NANDA?"}

Uses an iterative approach which is more efficient than recursion\n2. Handles basic error cases (negative numbers)\n3. Returns the nth Fibonacci number where F(1)=1, F(2)=1\n4. Uses multiple assignment for clean code\n\nYou can test different values by changing the 'n' variable. For example, running with n=10 will output \"The 10th Fibonacci number is: 55\"\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail?"}
