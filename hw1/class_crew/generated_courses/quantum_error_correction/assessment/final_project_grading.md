### VI. Examples of Work

#### A. Excellent (A) Example

*   **Business Component:** A business plan for a QEC-enabled drug discovery service that includes a comprehensive market analysis, a well-defined business model, realistic financial projections, and innovative strategic recommendations. The plan demonstrates a deep understanding of the pharmaceutical industry and the potential impact of QEC.
*   **Technical Component:** A fully functional simulation of a QEC scheme that achieves significant error reduction under realistic noise conditions. The simulation code is well-documented and easy to understand. The technical report provides a detailed analysis of the scheme's performance and limitations. The team justifies design choices based on thorough experimentation and simulation.
*   The team's presentation seamlessly integrates business and technical aspects, demonstrating clear communication and a unified vision.

#### B. Satisfactory (B) Example

*   **Business Component:** A business plan that covers the main aspects of the market, business model, and financial projections. The plan is generally well-written and organized, but lacks the depth and innovation of an "A" example.
*   **Technical Component:** A functional implementation of a QEC code and decoding algorithm. The simulation achieves some error reduction, but the performance is not optimized. The technical report provides a basic analysis of the scheme's performance.
*   The team collaborates effectively, but the integration of business and technical aspects could be improved.

#### C. Needs Improvement (C) Example

*   **Business Component:** A business plan that is poorly written, disorganized, or incomplete. The plan lacks key information or justification.
*   **Technical Component:** A partially implemented QEC code or decoding algorithm with significant errors or inefficiencies. The simulation achieves limited error reduction. The technical report is incomplete or inaccurate.
*   The team struggles to collaborate effectively, and the presentation is disorganized or difficult to follow.
